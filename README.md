# My Neovim config

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress.

This branch is my attempt to move away from AstroNvim and just use Lazy.
Comming from AstroNvim, this config will be inspired by AstroNvim, but
more minimal for my usecase, specifically C++ development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

#### Make a backup of your current nvim and shared folder

```shell
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak
mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak
```

#### Create a new user repository from this template

Press the "Use this template" button above to create a new repository to store your user configuration.

You can also just clone this repository directly if you do not want to track your user configuration in GitHub.

git clone https://github.com/<your_user>/<your_repository> ~/.config/nvim
```
